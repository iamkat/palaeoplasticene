# Sound Studies

## What are we investigating?

The central idea for Palaeoplasticene is to engage with the long-term life of plastic. Hearing is one of our senses, but listening is a skill. Listening is something we often don’t practice. Engaging with plastic through sound is an interesting challenge. How does one establish the audio aesthetics of plastic? We can also explore time and non-human subjectivities by engaging with sound. Fundamentally, the practice of sound studies / acoustic ecologies when applied within the palaeoplasticene project, is a way of researching plastic in long time. As such we pay attention not only to the soundscape, but also to the effect that the research has on our understanding of and relation to the topic.

## Acoustic ecology of the plastisphere

We can find and record sounds that relate in some way to plastic – either its material existence in the world, such as the tapping of a keyboard, a carrier bag in the wind or a needle in a vinyl record groove – or its relation to broader questions of the carbon cycle, such as the sound of a car engine, or the movement of a 3D printer. The act of listening for the presence of plastic forces us to think about the presence of it as a material pervading our daily lives, to see its presence in all things we take for granted, and to experience in a sensorial manner this heightened awareness. It creates an auditory tapestry of our plastic reality.

- Optional directional microphone, boom pole and deadcat

## General Listening Practice

- Take off your headphones or if you're listening with headphones, take one out of one ear.
- Stop moving.
- Breathe in and listen to your breath.
- Breathe out and listen to your breath.
- Repeat this 4 or 5 times.
- Now listen to the sounds around you. Don't try to identify the sounds you hear, but rather just to notice that they are there. Try to notice first the sounds that are closest to you. Then try to notice the sounds that are further away. Now, focus on the faintest sound you can hear. Listen to the quality of the sound. Is it high or low, does it rumble or is it sharp? Is it continuous or sporadic?
- Move on to the next closest sound you hear. Listen to its quality. Focus entirely on that sound. How does it make you feel?
- Move on to the next closest sound. Which direction does it come from? How long does it last?

## Finding Your Sound

Finding your sounds becomes a richer experience the longer you practice listening and exploring the opportunities for finding new audio aesthetics of plastic.

Pay attention to the materials around you. What is made of plastic, or coated with plastic? What sounds do they make without your intervention? Is your intervention needed for them to make sound? What is the difference in the meaning of the sound and what it means for an acoustic aesthetic of plastic if you must intervene to make a sound?

For instance, if there is a plastic bag in a tree, you can wait for the wind to move it and record the sound, or you can move it with your hands. The sound is different, and so is the meaning.

You may also want to try listening from the perspective of a non-human other, particularly those with longer lifetimes than humans. For instance, what happens if you listen from the perspective of a rock or a tree? What does this do to the temporal understanding of the sound? By listening with a non-human other, do you notice any effect on yourself and your perspective?

## Recording Tips

- Make sure you have enough battery in your recording device.
- If you have a choice, record in wav format. This gives us the best possible sound.
- Get your recording device as close to the source of the sound as you can.
- Point your microphone towards the sound you want to record.
- If you're recording in a windy environment, try to get hold of a baffle. If you don't have one, loosely wrap a scarf or hat around your microphone to break up the windy sound.
- Don't move! Any movement you make will be picked up by the microphone, and somehow that's always at the most interesting point!
- How do you know when to finish? Listen to the sound carefully – some sounds tell a story and will have an obvious start and finish. If the sound doesn't have this kind of start and finish, record for roughly one minute.
- If it's relevant to what you're recording, note down the location of where you are recording. If you have a smartphone, open a maps app, find your location and note down the coordinates.
