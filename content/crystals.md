# Crystals

## What are we investigating?

We are interested in how microplastics might influence the formation and growth of crystals. We are investigating the growth of calcite and alum crystals in the presence of microplastics and seeing how their structure might be altered during the growth process and whether the microplastics are actually incorporated into the structure. This is developing better understanding of the pervasive nature of microplastics in the environment and its potential coexistence and co-growth with/in rocks. Overall, the experiment aims to make people think about different perceptions of time and length of different natural cyclical renewal processes (for example, the carbon cycle, the water cycle etc.) particularly in relation to our sustainable survival on the planet. The experiment conveys the feeling of very long temporal cycles, as to how the impact of humans (represented by the production of a synthetic microplastic compound) may be felt at a geological time scale – i.e., in the formation of rocks. It also provokes awareness as to how such forms of pollution are now pervasive throughout the environment.

## What is crystal growing?

Crystallisation is the process of forming (through natural or artificial growth and design) solid crystals.

Crystals are solids that form by a regular repeated pattern of molecules connecting together: a collection of atoms is repeated in exactly the same arrangement over and over throughout the entire material. Crystals are usually too small to be seen by the naked eye, but they are easily identifiable as crystals when viewed under a microscope. Examples of crystals we might see in everyday life are bones, shells, plastics, metals, paints, soils, minerals and sand.

Geological crystals come in two basic types: biogenic (from biological sources) and abiogenic (non-biological). Abiogenic crystals are produced by different Earth processes such as cooling of magma/lava, drying salty water, or chemical reactions when different materials mix. Crystals often form around a nucleation point, and their size is determined by how much time the crystal has to grow. For example, granite, which is formed from magma that slowly solidified underground has relatively large crystals. This is in contrast with lava, which cools quickly at the surface, creating microscopic crystals. After formation, crystals can be put under additional stresses (temperatures and pressures) which can cause the atoms within the crystal to move around to form new crystals with a similar chemistry but different properties. For example, the mineral graphite under high pressure turns into diamond.

Biogenic minerals are those produced by an organism during its life, such as bones, which are primarily composed of calcium phosphate (also known as apatite), or shells, which are most often made of calcium carbonate (also known as calcite or aragonite). Calcium carbonate is such an important mineral that vast accumulations of it, such as coral reefs (coral make their bodies out of calcite), can have big impacts on global seawater chemistry. When these organisms die, their skeletons tend to fall apart and can form rocks, producing limestone.

## Experiment equipment list

### Calcite

- sodium carbonate (Na2CO3)
- calcium chloride (CaCl2)
- microplastic beads (fluorescent dyed if possible)
- 2 x I litre glass bottles
- plastic petri dish
- water

### Alum

- potassium aluminium sulphate KAl(SO4)2.12H2O
- microplastic beads (fluorescent dyed if possible)
- plastic petri dish
- water
- pan and stove

## How to run the experiment

### Calcite crystals

1. Add water to Na2CO3 powder to make a 3 mM aqueous solution (= 0.32 g powder mixed in one litre of water).
2. Add water to CaCl2 powder to make a 3 mM aqueous solution (=0.33 g powder mixed in one litre of water).
3. Add microplastics to the sodium carbonate solution and shake thoroughly.
4. Mix both solutions (sodium carbonate and calcium chloride) together and then pour a little of the mix onto a petri dish so that it just covers the base. Leave dish uncovered.
5. Wait 48 hours and very small crystals should have formed.

### Alum crystals

1. Stir alum into one litre of very hot water until no more will dissolve.
2. Mix in the microplastics into the solution.
3. Pour the solution into a petri dish and wait a few hours as it cools down and the crystals to grow.
4. If larger crystals are required then use the previous crystals as seed crystals in the petri dish and repeat steps 1 to 3.
