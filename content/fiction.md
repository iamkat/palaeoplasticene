# Fiction

## What are we investigating?

Our goal is to create speculative fiction that could help to analyze "what if" scenarios. This exercise is conceptually similar to a video game with a fixed set of action rules where the starting conditions may vary. We are aiming to change one element or one physical law of how the world works at a time and "run" an imaginary world over long time to see what effets that change might have on human actions and their perception towards the environment.

## What is speculative fiction?

Speculative fiction is a category of fiction where some elements do not exist in reality, nature or the present universe. It may also contain elements that explain phenomena that is unknown or has not yet been explored scientifically.

## How to write the fiction?

The process is iterative, alternating between building up a story and checking the integrity of the speculative world.

1. Come up with one speculative element, which would be different that present in the world today as we know it.
2. Come up with a timeline of the story.
3. Come up with the main story line.
4. Check the integrity of the fictional world while the story happens.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until perfection.
