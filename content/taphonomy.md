# Taphonomy

## What are we investigating?

The central idea for Palaeoplasticene is to engage with the long-term life of plastic. In this experiment we speculate into prehistoric times, where an evolutionary tipping point prompted a fungus to grow itself out of plastic. In our case, we have chosen PLA as the plastic of choice, because it is made of lactic acid monomer units, which occurs abundantly in nature. Our speculative past includes a set of environmental conditions that creates evolutionary circumstances where the prehistoric fungus benefits from growing this plastic material.

The central question of this experiment is: "How does the plastic mushroom change over time"?

As such, we will run an experiment to see how robust the PLA mushroom is, and to understand what evolutionary advantage there could be to the mushroom of a plastic materiality.

## What is taphonomy?

Taphonomy in a broad sense is the study of how organic remains pass from the biosphere to the lithosphere. For our purpose, it's the study of how matter decays and transforms. In some ways it can be understood as the study of entropy. It is commonly integrated with palaeontological research to better understand and thereby reconstruct the process of decay that results in what is observed in the fossil record. Taphonomic processes act over very long times, thus it is notoriously difficult to study experimentally. In regular taphonomic experiments, researchers would account naturally decaying carcasses over many years, or, in small scale studies they would leave a carcass in the open and return regularly to record its state of decomposition, including the action of other creatures in hastening the breakdown of the body. In the end, they can observe how many bones remain over time, how the bones are distributed and how they have been transformed, thereby giving a hint to the circumstances that may have surrounded the death and decomposition of a body from prehistory. Understanding the process of decay and transformation is equally relevant for forensic investigations, including those of the very recent past as well.

## Experiment equipment List

- Earthenware or terracotta pot (approx. 30 cm diameter and 15 cm deep) Soil
- 3D printed PLA prehistoric mushrooms ([Download the file](https://documents.katausten.com/index.php/s/k8yrY29Bs9EAmmE 'Mushroom file'))
- Small plants, moss, stones
- Small decaying branches
- Outdoor space (balcony, terrace, garden, community garden)
- Patience and time

## How to set it up

- Place your pot somewhere outside that is secure and accessible to you on a regular basis
- Fill your earthenware pot with soil until approx. 3cm from the lip
- Place your 3D printed mushroom within the pot, slightly covering the foot with soil
- Arrange your branches, small plants etc. so that they form a landscape around your mushroom
- Take your first photographs (see below)

## How to document the experiment

The aim of the documentation is to show the change over time of the prehistoric mushrooms. The best way to do that is to ensure you document using the same frame for the photo each time. As it can be impractical to have a camera in place outdoors long term, it's important to maximise your possibilities for taking photos from the same distance and angle time after time.

- Take photos at the same time of day across the experiment.
- Take photos from:
  - front and each side of the pot at an angle of around 45 degrees from the horizontal surface of the soil inside
  - top view looking directly downwards
- Aim to fill 25% of the frame with the prehistoric mushrooms. If you are unable to also include the whole of the pot, you can take an additional view from further away.
- Make sure to capture the different angles in approximately the same position for every shot: Take photos from the same distance. Use either measuring tape or a knotted length of string to gauge distance.
- Take photos from the same angle: This is most easily achieved with a tripod, where you set the height and angle according to recorded values. If you don't have a tripod, find a chair, block, brick or similar on which you can rest your elbows to achieve approximately the same height each time.
- A good way to check is to compare your current camera preview with the last photograph of that angle you took: if the size of the object in the previous photo is the same as in your current shot then the distance to the object is pretty much the same (assuming that you do not change the zoom or focal length of your camera)
- If you are using a tripod and have the option to, it can be helpful to mark the position of the tripod's feed with masking tape. Make a note of the orientation of the camera with respect to the tripod and any angles on the head of the tripod.
- Be careful not to get your own shadow in the photo frame.
- Make sure to focus the camera on the same part of the prehistoric mushroom each time.
- If your camera allows you to control it, use a wide depth of field - ie: set your F-stop to a higher number (small lens aperture), which shows detail over a larger distance from the camera and allows you to capture detail from the whole mushroom.
