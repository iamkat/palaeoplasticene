# Incidental Taphonomy

## What are we investigating?

The central idea for Palaeoplasticene is to engage with the long-term life of plastic. In the practice of Incidental Taphonomy, we carry out taphonomy "in the wild" as a juxtaposition to our controlled taphonomy experiments with 3D printed mushrooms ([Download the file](https://documents.katausten.com/index.php/s/k8yrY29Bs9EAmmE 'Mushroom file')). By exploring the outside world and paying attention to the taphonomy of plastic, we gain insight into the dispersal of plastic in the environment and have a chance to observe the progress of its gradual embedding into a more-than-human timeframe.

## What is taphonomy?

Taphonomy in a broad sense is the study of how organic remains pass from the biosphere to the lithosphere. For our purpose, it's the study of how matter decays and transforms. In some ways it can be understood as the study of entropy. It is commonly integrated with palaeontological research to better understand and thereby reconstruct the process of decay that results in what is observed in the fossil record. Taphonomic processes act over very long times, thus it is notoriously difficult to study experimentally. In regular taphonomic experiments, researchers would account naturally decaying carcasses over many years, or, in small scale studies they would leave a carcass in the open and return regularly to record its state of decomposition, including the action of other creatures in hastening the breakdown of the body. In the end, they can observe how many bones remain over time, how the bones are distributed and how they have been transformed, thereby giving a hint to the circumstances that may have surrounded the death and decomposition of a body from prehistory. Understanding the process of decay and transformation is equally relevant for forensic investigations, including those of the very recent past as well.

## How to practice incidental taphonomy

Begin when you are outside. As you are traversing the streets and roads, notice if you see items out of place, or if you see plastic objects. These may be discarded wrappers, face masks, cigarette butts, plastic furniture, car tyres... Start taking photos of these objects, showing some context. If you return to this place at a later stage, see whether you can track down the object that you photographed. Make an album or repo of your photographs so that you can view them all together. What do you observe about the photographs and your reaction to them?

Iterate on the practice - do you need to change how you photograph in response to viewing the documentation so far? Do you see incidental taphonomy also inside? Do the photographs tell a story?
