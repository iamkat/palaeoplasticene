Open Artistic Research Platform development for the  project Palaeoplasticene

This repo tracks the development of an art-led participatory platform for transdisciplinary open research. 

From a starting point of collaboration between people of diverse backgrounds we are developing a platform to facilitate transdisciplinary artistic research by non-artists into the long-term existence of microplastic. Designed to be adaptable to multiple artistic research contexts and to be re-deployable by other researchers, this platform development highlights the unique challenges, and rigour, of artistic research.

Interested in contributing or commenting? Please do! This is an exploratory process and we would be very grateful for feedback.

Palaeoplasticene is coded by @andreasbdsch

The platform is developed within the context of the Palaeoplasticene project, a collaboration between Kat Austen, Indrė Žliobaitė and Laurence Gill. 

Palaeoplasticene is an artistic research project exploring microplastic persistence through long timescales. Addressing the ubiquity and longevity of microplastic in the environment, Palaeoplasticene is a developing series of distributed transdisciplinary experiments that question the agency of plastic through “Long Time”.

Palaeoplasticene is realised through the STUDIOTOPIA programme, hosted by [Ars Electronica](https://ars.electronica.art/digitalhumanism/en/studiotopia/), which facilitates artists hosting scientists-in-residence and examines art-science collaborations. STUDIOTOPIA is Co-funded by the Creative Europe Programme of the European Union.
